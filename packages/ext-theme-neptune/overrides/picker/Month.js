    // Monthpicker contains logic that reduces the margins of the month items if it detects
    // that the text has wrapped.  This can happen in the classic theme  in certain
    // locales such as zh_TW.  In order to work around this, Month picker measures
    // the month items to see if the height is greater than "measureMaxHeight".
    // In neptune the height of the items is larger, so we must increase this value.
    // While the actual height of the month items in neptune is 24px, we will only 
    // determine that the text has wrapped if the height of the item exceeds 36px.
    // this allows theme developers some leeway to increase the month item size in
    // a neptune-derived theme.
